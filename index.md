🔍 Seeking: Technical Writer/Content Developer/Content Localization/Instructional Design roles

About Me:

• 2+ years of technical writing experience as a Content Developer for Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) products such as PIM and Access Reviews<br>
• 1+ years of support engineering experience with the Azure Enterprise (EA) subscriptions and billing support team<br>
• Microsoft Certified in Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)<br>
• Recent working abroad experience in Japan<br>

⭐ Why You Should Consider Me:

At Microsoft, I've fostered a growth mindset with the humbleness to learn from senior colleagues and the willingness to help others. I have a strong desire to grow my career and I'm very passionate about the intersection of technology, language, and education.

🚀 What I'm Looking For:

I'm seeking a role (in the US or remote) that will allow me to learn more about new technologies and to grow as a technical writer, localization strategist, and/or editor. If you are a hiring manager or recruiter, I would love to work with you!
