üîç Seeking: Technical Writing/ Cloud Computing/ Content Development/ Instructional Design 

About Me:

‚Ä¢ Currently working as a technical writer at Aquent for Microsoft (contract) on a variety of support and end user documentation.<br>
‚Ä¢ 2+ years of technical writing experience as a Content Developer for Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) products such as PIM and Access Reviews.<br>
‚Ä¢ 1+ years of support engineering experience with the Azure Enterprise (EA) subscriptions and billing support team.<br>
‚Ä¢ Microsoft Certified in Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900).<br>
‚Ä¢ Working abroad experience as an ALT in Japan.<br>

‚≠ê Why You Should Consider Me:

At Microsoft, I've fostered a growth mindset with the humbleness to learn from senior colleagues and the willingness to help others. In addition to having a solid background in supporting Azure cloud services, I have a strong desire to grow my career and I'm very passionate about the intersection of technology, education, and language.

üöÄ What I'm Looking For:

I'm seeking a role (in the US or remote) that will allow me to learn more about new technologies and to grow as a technical writer, content developer, and/or instructional designer. If you are a hiring manager or recruiter, I would love to work with you!
