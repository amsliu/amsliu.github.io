üîç Seeking: Technical Writer/Content Developer/Content Editor/Content Localization roles

About Me:

‚Ä¢ 2+ years of technical writing experience as a Content Developer for Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) products such as PIM and Access Reviews
‚Ä¢ 1+ years of support engineering experience with the Azure Enterprise (EA) subscriptions and billing support team
‚Ä¢ Microsoft Certified in Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)
‚Ä¢ Recent working abroad experience in Japan

‚≠ê Why You Should Consider Me:

At Microsoft, I've fostered a growth mindset with the humbleness to learn from senior colleagues and the willingness to help others. I have a strong desire to grow as a technical writer and I'm very passionate about the intersection of technology, language, and education.

üöÄ What I'm Looking For:

I'm seeking a role (in the US or remote) that will allow me to learn more about new technologies and to grow as a technical writer, localization strategist, and/or editor. If you are a hiring manager or recruiter, I would love to work with you!
